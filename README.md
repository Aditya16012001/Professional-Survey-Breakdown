Professional Survey Breakdown - Power BI Dashboard
Project Overview
This project analyzes real-world survey data to extract insights into work-life balance, salary satisfaction, and job demographics. We leveraged Power BI for data transformation, visualization, and dashboard creation.

Data Cleaning & Transformation
Raw survey data often requires extensive preprocessing before analysis. In this project, we performed the following steps:
Splitting complex columns (e.g., country, profession) using the left delimiter for better categorization.
Creating calculated fields, such as extracting salary values and generating an average salary column.
Removing empty and redundant columns that did not contribute meaningful insights.

Power BI Dashboard Features
The dashboard visualizes key findings using interactive charts, including:
Gauge Charts – Measuring happiness levels (work-life balance & salary).
Bar Charts – Comparing average salaries by job title.
Tree Map – Displaying the geographical distribution of survey respondents.
Donut Chart – Visualizing salary distribution by gender.

Technologies Used
Power BI – Data visualization and dashboard creation
Excel – Data cleaning and preprocessing
Conclusion
This project showcases how Power BI can be used to analyze and visualize real-world data, offering valuable insights for decision-making. Feel free to explore the dataset and Power BI report files in this repository!
